The Nissan GT-R Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) 
is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both
 a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds
  the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation
   to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived
    from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line
     at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.

As per Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was
 revived as part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following seven years
  of development and testing, including the introduction of two concept models in 2001 and 2005. The
   production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The GT-R is a brand-new car 
   built on the PM platform, and featured innovative concepts and technologies, such as advanced aerodynamics,
    the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, making it
     the first ever rear mounted independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first production 
     cars to feature launch control and a dual-clutch transmission as well. The overall body is made out of steel,
      aluminium and carbon-fibre. In 2009 it set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.

The GT-R is offered worldwide, unlike its predecessors which 
were sold in a limited number of markets. It received various facelifts and updates
 to be up to date with the competition, and several special editions
 were also offered during its prolonged production span. The car is
  used in motorsports, notably winning championships in the FIA GT1 World
   Championship, Super GT and in various GT3 racing series, including the GT World 
   Challenge. It is well received among enthusiasts and automotive publications as well,
    British motor magazine Top Gear named it as "one of the most incredible 
    cars of any kind 
    ever built", due its exceptional performance and practicality given at an affordable price.
     Despite being one of the fastest production cars, it has won numerous notable accolades such
      as the World Performance Car of The Year among many others.

Sales in the Australian market were ceased due to new side impact
 regulations. In the European market, including the United Kingdom 
 were similarly suspended, due to newly implemented noise regulations
 . Currently, the car is primarily available only in the North America, Japan, and some markets</p>
